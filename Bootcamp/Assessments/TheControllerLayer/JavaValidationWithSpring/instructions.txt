Challenge: Validation Constraints
For this challenge, you may use the official Javax Validation Constraint site. You may not visit any additional websites.

Create a MenuItem class.

The MenuItem class should have four private variables and include all getters and setters:

id - a unique integer identifier
name - the name of the menuItem
price - a Big Decimal value
year - an integer value of the year the item was added to the menu
Using Validation Constraints enforce the following rules:

No elements should be null
The maximum allowable price should be 18.50
The year can have at most 4 digits
Remember that primitive values can never have a null value. To enforce the rule that elements should not be null on a primitive, you must use the appropriate wrapper class. Also. This class is NOT a model, do not add any other annotation related to models.
