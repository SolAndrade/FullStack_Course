Challenge: Prescription Service
In this challenge, you will build an application to help pharmacies fill prescriptions.

There is a database of doctors and a database of drugs. You will leverage these databases to build prescriptionOrderForms.

When a patient is issued a prescription, the patient's name, weight, drugId and doctorId are sent to the Controller which then calls the fillOrder method in the Prescription service.

The fillOrder method

retrieves the drug name and dosageRate from the database and the doctor's name from the database
calculates the correct dosage based on patient weight and dosageRate (weight * dosageRate)
returns a PrescriptionOrderForm to object with the patient name, doctor name, dosage and drug name
Set Up

@Repository
public interface DoctorRepository extends JpaRepository<Doctor, Integer> {
}
@Repository
public interface DrugRepository extends JpaRepository<Drug, Integer> {
}
Entities
@Entity
public class Doctor{
  private int id;
  private String name; 
}
@Entity
public class Drug{
  private int id;
  private String name; 
  private double dosageRate; 
}
DTO

public class PrescriptionOrderForm{
  private String patientName;
  private String doctorName; 
  private String drugName; 
  private double dosage;
}
Payload from Controller
